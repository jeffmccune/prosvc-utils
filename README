Creates a new Puppet Application that can be used for testing.

Assumes that you follow Puppetlab's best practices for testing.

All modules should have a test directory that mirrors the
manifests directory.

INSTALLATION:

It must be in the same directory as your core puppet source unless you apply the following patch:

http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/5977

This patch should be merged into 2.6.5

This should allow you to place it in a directory that is included in RUBYLIB.

module.

USAGE:

puppet test --check_tests [--environment ENV]
  check that all manifests in the modulepath have corresponding tests manifests.

puppet test --compile_tests --factnode FOO [--run_noop] [--environment]
  check that we can compile all of the manifests in the test directory.
  factnode - node whose facts we will use for all of the test compiles. This
    must exist in /var/lib/puppet/yaml/facts/FOO.yaml
      NOTE - should be using facter
  run_noop - run the catalogs on noop after we compile.
    -environment to compile against

puppet test --test_nodes (NODE|--all) [--node_type (facts|node)]
  test_nodes - nodes to tests --all is all nodes
  node_type - whether the nodes are serialized from node yaml or facts yaml

NOTE - by default all catalogs are compiled to '/var/lib/puppet/tests'


puppet parser - parses puppet code.
  puppet parser --get_nodes MANIFEST
    returns a list of all nodes in a MANIFEST

puppet catalog CATALOG
  - prints the titles from a resource
puppet catalog --filter TYPE CATALOG
  - print all resources of a certain type from a catalog
puppet catalog CATALOG --summary
  - shows how many resoures of each type exist in a catalog


puppet diff CATALOG1 CATALOG2
  - this can show the differences in resources
  - it works for the simples use cases, except:
     - requires that puppet be able to find source locations for files (when in to_ral mode)
     - still needs to little work to support 0.25.x
